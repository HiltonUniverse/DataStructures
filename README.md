# Data Structures and Algorithms
The main goal is to learn and master as many data structures and algoritms as possible.

# Setup
* We have a main.cpp file that basically triggers a function that every DSA practice class has under namespace test{}.
  What it basically does is to call the DSA of interest, pass it correct test data and print it's output.
* Every new DAS is written in a .h file to keep things simple and save time.
* Every DSA has it's Time and Space Complexity calculated.

# Note
No unit test have been written, at least for now because of the amount of time it takes to do so. More focused on learning the basics at
the moment. Future implementations can have unittests.
